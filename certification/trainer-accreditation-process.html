        <h2>How to become a SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> Certified Trainer (SCT<sup>&reg;</sup>)?</h2>
        <p class="inner-body-first-text-block">
            SCRUM trainings for several certification exams (including SMC<sup>&reg;</sup>, SPOC<sup>&reg;</sup>, SAMC<sup>&trade;</sup> and ESMC<sup>&trade;</sup>) should preferably be conducted in classrooms or through virtual instructor led sessions. It is important for every SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> faculty to be an expert in the particular SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> certification he or she is teaching, and be very familiar with the concepts in the SBOK<sup>&reg;</sup> Guide. It is also important for the faculty to be a good teacher and have adequate soft-skills to handle different situations in a class, and consistently deliver very high quality trainings. <br>

        </p>
        <h3>Process for becoming an accredited SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> Certified Trainer (SCT<sup>&reg;</sup>):</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trainers need to have at least 2 years of relevant work experience and should be willing to share their experiences in the classes they teach.</li>
            <li>They need to successfully pass any three SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> certification exams (out of SDC<sup>&reg;</sup>, SMC<sup>&reg;</sup>, SAMC<sup>&trade;</sup>, and SPOC<sup>&reg;</sup>), including the certification course that they wish to teach.</li>
            <li>They need to be aware of the training resources available in SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> A.T.P. site (including videos, handbooks, recording of past training sessions etc). SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> will provide substantial training resources which A.T.P.s and Trainers can customize and use for their classes - the training resources will focus more on SCRUM concepts rather than on how to pass SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> certification exams. Other than the training resources available in SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup>, additional custom content may need to be developed by individual A.T.P.s or Trainers.</li>
            <li>All Trainers should be associated with a SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> A.T.P.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="">Once trainers complete the above requirements, they need to <a href="..\home\new-trainer-application.html">apply</a> to SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> to become an accredited trainer (mentioning the details of the A.T.P. with whom they are associated). Accredited Trainers will be certified as "SCRUMtradestudy<sup>&trade;</sup> Certified Trainers (SCT<sup>&reg;</sup>s)" - and they will be awarded an accreditation certificate making them eligible to train students for SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> certifications. They should train only for the A.T.P.s with whom they have got associated. </p>
        <p class="">To ensure a high-quality learning experience for all our students, trainers need to consistently get high rankings in student feedback forms. SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> will regularly ask for feedback from students who attend classes conducted by SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> A.T.P.s Faculty who receive unfavorable feedback must work on improving their course delivery, or their accreditation as SCT<sup>&reg;</sup>s may be terminated. SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> reserves its right to terminate any SCT<sup>&reg;</sup> from continuing training for SCRUMstudy<sup>&trade;</sup> classes because of poor feedback or for other reasons.</p>
