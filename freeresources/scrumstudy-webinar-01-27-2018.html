                        The responsibilities of the project manager are
                        split among the Scrum core team. There is no Project Manager role in Scrum.
                        Scrum believes in self-organized team that does not need to be “managed.”

                        One of the Product Owner’s key responsibilities

                        two to three Sprints are refined into suitable User Stories. It is
                        recommended that the Product Owner should spend a significant amount of the
                        time in each Sprint for Prioritized Product Backlog grooming. The Product
                        Owner is responsible for adding and revising Prioritized Product Backlog
                        Items in response to any changes and is responsible for providing more
                        detailed User Stories that will be used for the next Sprint.

                        Product owner is responsible for updating the
                        Prioritized Product Backlog. It can be updated any number of times during the

                        The scope of a Sprint once started cannot be
                        changed which means that you cannot remove user stories from a Sprint once
                        the Sprint has started. If Product Owner wants to replace a user story, then
                        the current Sprint will have to be cancelled and new Sprint will have to be

                        The accountability is that of the entire Scrum

                        Scrum is best suited for such an environment. The
                        Scrum Team will try to understand the objectives that the customer wants to
                        achieve and try to provide the outputs that can help achieve them through a
                        trial and learn method. Empirical process control and iterative development
                        help achieve it.

                    If a user story that was worked upon in a Sprint
                    got descoped half way through the Sprint, it would mean, all the work that
                    went in was wasted. This adds to project costs. Is it desirable to totally
                    descope requirements in the midst of a Sprint?

                        If a user story is no longer required, then it is
                        not advisable to spend anything more on it even if you have spent 50% of your
                        budget. At times it might mean canceling the sprint and starting a new Sprint
                        with the changed requirements and priorities.

                        Delivering projects through facilitation rather
                        than command and control. Scrum Master is more of a facilitator/servant

                        It is similar to a stage but it is governed

                        You will get a good idea as we go through this
                        session. For example, in some vendor projects where I was involved with, we
                        had several Scrum teams in the vendor organization who were coordinating with
                        a Product Owner in our company. In today’s scenario colocation is not always
                        possible but in such situations you need to leverage technology to enable
                        communication amongst team members for meetings such as daily standups.

                        Prioritized Product Backlog grooming should
                        happen throughout the project and can include situations in which the Product
                        Owner writes new User Stories or reprioritizes User Stories in the existing
                        Prioritized Product Backlog, Scrum Team members or Stakeholders give their
                        suggestions about new User Stories to the Product Owner, and so forth. It is
                        important to note that any item in the Prioritized Product Backlog is always
                        open for re-estimation until the Sprint Backlog is finalized in the Create
                        Sprint Backlog process. After that, changes can continue to be made until
                        immediately prior to the Sprint Planning Meeting, if required.

                    I'm just learning SCRUM and am supporting a
                    digital team - we receive many requests from the business to make changes to
                    websites. Part of the key to SCRUM is determining business value - is there a
                    standard approach in the digital environment i.e. how do you value adding a
                    banner to a website? How do you value developing a new landing page for
                    comparison purposes?

                        Hi Greg, all the changes that you receive have to
                        be prioritized based on the business value that a business will derive from
                        implementing those changes. For example, for a new landing page, the business
                        value could be more traffic to the webpage resulting in more
                        conversions/revenues for the business. It is for the business to determine,
                        which change requests should be prioritized based on their respective
                        business values. There are different prioritization techniques such as paired
                        comparisons, MoSCoW technique, planning poker, etc. These will be discussed
                        later in the presentation.

                        A Release Planning Schedule is one of the key
                        outputs of the Conduct Release Planning process. A Release Planning Schedule
                        states released which deliverables are to be to the customers, along with
                        planned intervals, and dates for releases. There may not be a release
                        scheduled at the end of every Sprint iteration. At times, a release may be
                        planned after a group of Sprint iterations are completed. Depending on the
                        organization’s strategy, Release Planning sessions in projects may be driven
                        by functionality, in which the objective is to deliver once a predetermined
                        set of functionality has been developed, or the planning may be driven by
                        date, in which the release happens on a predefined date. The deliverable
                        should be released when it offers sufficient business value to the customer.

                        The optimum size for a Scrum Team is six to ten members—large
                        enough to ensure adequate skill sets, but small enough to collaborate easily.
                        A key benefit of a six-to-ten-member team is that communication and
                        management are typically simple and require minimal effort. It is important
                        for the Scrum Team to possess all the essential skills required to carry out
                        the work of the project. It is also necessary to have a high level of
                        collaboration to maximize productivity, so that minimal coordination is
                        required to get things done.

                        Yes, each team should ideally be following Scrum
                        and using it to deliver projects. Although, based on your question, it seems your
                        team members are multi-tasking (working on different projects

                        A fixed price contract can only work if the scope
                        is more or less fixed and you do not anticipate much changes. A Scrum project
                        tends to be meant for projects where there is not much clarity on Scope and
                        the teams expect a lot of changes as the project moves forward. As such fixed
                        price contract will not generally work with Scrum projects.

                    With what was just said about no formality of
                    change control procedure -- the answer I had picked -- my concerns remains
                    that such imprecise documentation may break down accountability leading
                    either to introduction of the P.M.'s personal preference or a unethical P.M.

                        Hi Ned, even in the case of Scrum projects,
                        change are not incorporated without any thoughts. The Product Owner when
                        confronted with change requests will have to assess it against the
                        cost/benefit analysis and only if the business value resulting from the
                        change makes sense, it will be approved. Also, once a Sprint has started, the
                        scope of the Sprint cannot be changed unless the Product Owner is ready to
                        take the burden of getting a Sprint cancelled. What also goes in favor of
                        Scrum is the in-built transparency in its processes. You cannot hide many
                        things in Scrum.

                    How does Quality of Scrum projects satisfy
                    Validated projects ?

                    <p>
                        Quality in Scrum is ensured through: Deliverables
                        which meet the User Story Acceptance Criteria are accepted by the Product
                        Owner. The objective of a Sprint is to create potentially shippable
                        deliverables, or product increments, which meet the Acceptance Criteria
                        defined by the customer and Product Owner. These are considered Accepted
                        Deliverables that may be released to the customer if they so desire. A list
                        of Accepted Deliverables is maintained and updated after each Sprint Review
                        Meeting. If a deliverable does not meet the defined Acceptance Criteria, it
                        is not considered accepted and will usually be carried forward into a
                        subsequent Sprint to rectify any issues. This is highly undesirable because
                        the objective of every Sprint is for the deliverables to meet the criteria
                        for acceptance.

                        It will be easier if the said vendor also follows
                        Scrum. At the end of the day, changes would have its own cost and as such
                        every change that is approved should be assessed in terms of cost vs.
                        benefit. Only if the business value of the change is more than the costs
                        associated, the change request should be incorporated in the Prioritized
                        Product Backlog.

                        No backlog does not mean being behind in the

                        define where user stories are written and prioritized. As oxford dictionary

                        needing to be dealt with”, a product backlog is a list of tasks which need to

                        Tools to access risk are similar to tools used
                        for risk in other projects. Few techniques are pareto analysis, probability
                        trees, probability impact grid, etc. Details are available in the SBOK<sup>&reg;</sup> Guide

                    Do we need to document risks when using a tool
                    like JIRA or can we just be aware of them and document them offline? Does
                    there need to be an issue/risk underneath the user story, that is, is there a
                    hierarchical relationship between risk and user story?

                        It will depend on the format you are using for
                        the product backlog. Yes, risk and associated user story should be linked.
                        And it is always a good practice to document identified risks. You can do it
                        with JIRA too.

                        Few of the processes from the Initiate phase will
                        repeat but not all. For example, writing Epics might be iterative because of

                        Prioritized Product Backlog contains a
                        prioritized list of business and project requirements written in the form of
                        Epic(s), which are high level User Stories. The Prioritized Product Backlog
                        is based on three primary factors: value, risk or uncertainty, and
                        dependencies. The list of the tasks to be executed by the Scrum Team in the
                        upcoming Sprint is called the Sprint Backlog.
                        &nbsp;It is common practice that the Sprint Backlog is
                        represented on a Scrumboard or task board, which provides a constantly

                        Different teams estimate differently although
                        estimation in terms of relative sizing (story points) has become very
                        popular. Story points can be used for estimating the overall size of a User
                        Story or feature. This approach assigns a story point value based on an
                        overall assessment of the size of a User Story with consideration given to
                        risk, amount of effort required, and level of complexity. This assessment
                        will be conducted by the Scrum Team and a story point value will be assigned.
                        Once an evaluation is done on one User Story in the Prioritized Product
                        Backlog, the Scrum Team can then evaluate other User Stories relative to that
                        first story.

                        Unlike Traditional PM, Scrum accepts changes.
                        Product Owner (who represents the customer) can make changes to the PPB
                        regularly and prioritize requirements. In traditional PM, changes are not
                        allowed easily and usually, scope has to be defined and documented in the
                        beginning (which takes a lot of time, and may not be useful since all
                        requirements may not be known at project initiation). Scrum is an iterative
                        Agile approach and is quickly replacing traditional PM in most companies.

                    since practitioners are remote and in it for the $$$.)

                        It is a common issue mentioned by most project
                        leaders. The trick is to make members feel involved and for them to realize
                        that their suggestions are not being thrown into the bin but are actually put
                        to use.

                    It seems that there is a component of living the

                    key -- members live that spirit? One does not always have control over who is
                    assigned to the team or not. Some organizations make removal of dullards

                        intrinsically transparent. So, every morning during a daily standup, every
                        member will have to give an update of what they have done and what they
