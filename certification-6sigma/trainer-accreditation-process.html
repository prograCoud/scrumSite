        <h3>How to become a 6sigmastudy™ Certified Trainer (SSCT™)?</h3>
        <p>Six Sigma training for certification exams such as SSGB™, SSBB™, LSSGB™, and LSSBB™ should preferably be conducted in classrooms or through virtual instructor led sessions. It is important for every 6sigmastudy™ faculty to be an expert in the particular 6sigmastudy™ certification he or she is teaching. It is also important for the faculty to be a good teacher and have adequate soft-skills to handle different situations in a class, and consistently deliver very high-quality training.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Process for becoming an accredited 6sigmastudy™ Certified Trainer (SSCT™):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Trainers need to have at least 2 years of relevant work experience and should be willing to share their experiences in the classes they teach.
            </li>
            <li>
                They need to successfully pass any two 6sigmastudy™ certification exams (out of SSGB™, SSBB™, LSSGB™, and LSSBB™), including the certification course that they wish to teach.
            </li>
            <li>
                They need to be aware of the training resources available in 6sigmastudy™ A.T.P. portal such as videos, handbooks, and recording of past training sessions. 6sigmastudy™ will provide substantial training resources which A.T.P.s and trainers can customize and use for their classes - the training resources will focus more on Six Sigma concepts rather than on how to pass 6sigmastudy™ certification exams. Other than the training resources available on the A.T.P portal, additional custom content may need to be developed by individual A.T.P.s or trainers.
            </li>
            <li>
                All trainers must be associated with a 6sigmastudy™ A.T.P.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Once trainers complete the above requirements, they need to apply to 6sigmastudy™ to become an accredited trainer (mentioning the details of the A.T.P. with whom they are associated). Accredited Trainers will be certified as a "6sigmastudy™ Certified Trainer (SSCT™)" and they will be awarded an accreditation certificate making them eligible to train students for 6sigmastudy™ certifications. They should train only for the A.T.P.s with whom they are associated.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure high-quality learning experience for all our students, trainers need to consistently get high ratings in student feedback forms. 6sigmastudy™ will regularly ask for feedback from students who attend classes conducted by 6sigmastudy™ A.T.P.s. Faculty who receive unfavorable feedback must work on improving their course delivery, or their accreditation as SSCT™ may be terminated. 6sigmastudy™ reserves its right to terminate any SSCT™ from continuing training for 6sigmastudy™ classes because of poor feedback or for similar other reasons.
        </p>
